THREADING ?

Threading strategy that I used in the dots project
main thread would thread collision
wait for those to be done
then thread the gameobject update and "pre render" 
	(if a dot was still alive after its update it sent its rendering data 
	to the renderer to be added to a pixel buffer)
after the threaded updates are complete the main loop tells the renderer to send the pixel buffer to the gpu to render the screen



the dots engine did not respond to user input...
	so for my engine I need to consider: 
	if an event happens mid threaded update what do I want to happen?
	Collect that event data to be processed after all the threading has completed
	then distribute it to appropriate systems before threading happens again?


	Systems I want or need in my engine

system for simulating playmode in editor
	wrap editor only behavior in an ifDef? 
	Debug builds can start with main func args to set wether it's editor or playmode?
	Release builds have editor mode things stripped out?

audio system



============================

gameplay


editor or runtime layer 

on play
start game state machine


Game class 
	contains a state machine
	a list of scenes and logic of how/when to swap
	OnUpdate()
	player cross level data struct
		score etc


mover component
	called on update
	gets transform from entity... scriptable component is probably the easiest way to set this up?
